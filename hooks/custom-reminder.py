1. **Understand the codebase** - Read relevant files/tables/documents to understand the codebase
2. **Identify 5-8 most likely root causes** - List potential reasons for the issue
3. **Choose the 3 most likely causes** - Prioritize based on probability and impact
4. **Decide whether to implement or debug** - If the cause is obvious, implement the fix and inform the user. If the cause is not obvious, continue this workflow.

Steps for Non-obvious Causes:
5. **For each of the 3 causes, validate by adding targeted logging/debugging**
6. **Let the user test** - Have them run the code with the new logging
7. **Fix when solution is found** - Implement the actual fix once root cause is confirmed
8. **Remove debugging logs** - Clean up temporary debugging code

Include relevant debugging commands/tools and explain your reasoning for each step.

INVESTIGATION_PROMPT = """
<system-reminder>The user has mentioned a key word or phrase that triggers this reminder.

<investigation-workflow>
1. **Assess scope and context**
   - If files/context provided: Read them directly to understand the code
   - If large codebase with unclear starting point: Use code-finder agent
   - If simple/obvious location: Use direct tools (Read, Grep, Glob)

2. **When to use code-finder agent**:
   - Complex investigations across unknown codebase sections
   - No clear starting point or files provided
   - Need to discover patterns/implementations across many files
   - Looking for specific functionality with unclear location
   
3. **When NOT to use code-finder**:
   - Simple searches in known files (use Read/Grep directly)
   - When specific file paths are provided
   - For trivial lookups that can be done with single Grep/Glob

4. **Investigation flow**:
   - Start with provided context/files if any
   - Use code-finder for broad discovery only when needed
   - Focus on understanding before suggesting changes
   - Answer the question first, implement only if asked

5. **Using multiple agents for complex tasks**:
   - Split complex investigations into non-overlapping domains
   - Each agent gets distinct search areas to avoid duplication
   - Launch parallel agents in single function_calls block with multiple Task invocations
   - Example: One agent searches backend/, another frontend/, third checks tests/

Example: "Investigate and make plan out Stripe integration" → Use multiple code-finder tasks
Example: "Where is combat implemented?" → Use code-finder task
Example: "Do we have a formatDate function" → Use grep/bash/etc tools directly
</investigation-workflow>

This workflow ensures efficient investigation based on task complexity.

Only after reading and understanding this guide should you provide prompt improvement recommendations.
